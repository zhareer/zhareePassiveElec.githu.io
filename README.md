# Introduction to Passive Circuits

Passive circuits are fundamental building blocks in electronics, consisting of components that do not require an external power source to operate. These components include resistors, capacitors, and inductors. Unlike active components (such as transistors or diodes), passive components cannot amplify a signal but can influence voltage, current, and energy storage within a circuit.

## Key Components of Passive Circuits

### 1. Resistors
Resistors are used to limit current and divide voltage in a circuit. They dissipate energy in the form of heat and are characterized by their resistance value, measured in ohms (Î©).

### 2. Capacitors
Capacitors store electrical energy in an electric field and are used for filtering, energy storage, and signal coupling. Their capacitance is measured in farads (F).

### 3. Inductors
Inductors store energy in a magnetic field when current flows through them. They are commonly used in filtering and energy storage applications. Their inductance is measured in henrys (H).
